# EditorConfig is awesome: https://EditorConfig.org
# Cite - Settings from example config on editorcongig site.

# top-most EditorConfig file
root = true

# Unix-style newlines with a newline ending every file
[*]
insert_final_newline = true

# Matches multiple files with brace expansion notation
# Set default charset
[*.{js,ts,py}]
end_of_line = lf 
charset = utf-8
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2

## note ---
## According to info on editorconfig extention, these settings only work on save ~
## end_of_line (on save)
## insert_final_newline (on save)
## trim_trailing_whitespace (on save)
## So... they essentially work in tandem or as support if also set on prettier.

# 4 space indentation
# [*.py]
# indent_style = space
# indent_size = 4

# Tab indentation (no size specified)
# [Makefile]
# indent_style = tab

# Indentation override for all JS under lib directory
# [lib/**.js]
# indent_style = space
# indent_size = 2

# Matches the exact files either package.json or .travis.yml
[{package.json,.travis.yml}]
